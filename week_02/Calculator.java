/**
 * 1. Write a method for addition that takes two doubles as parameters and returns a double
 * 2. Write a method for subtraction that takes two doubles as parameters and returns a double
 * 3. Write a method for division that takes two doubles as parameters and returns a double
 * 4. if the second parameter is 0 it must print "undefined" and then return 0 (for your program to work)
 * 5. Write a method for multiplication that takes two doubles as parameters and returns a double
 * 6. Write a method overload for multiplication that takes one parameter and returns the value of that parameter multiplied by itself. for full credit this overload must have the same method name as the original method
 * 
 * In a separate file MyProgram.java test out the methods above
 * 7. add the following pairs (5,5), (10,1) , (7,5) , (9,4) in this order
 * 8. subtract the following (100,86), (55,40), (73, 57), (41,24) in this order
 * 9. divide the following (33,0), (108,6), (76,4), (140,7) in this order
 * 10a. multiply the following (3,7) , (2,11)
 * 10b. use the method overload of multiply to square the following (4.8) , (4.9), (5)
